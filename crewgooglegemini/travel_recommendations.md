**Nakhon Sawan on a 0 THB Budget: A 2-Day Itinerary**

This itinerary focuses on experiencing Nakhon Sawan's natural beauty and cultural sites while adhering to a strict 0 THB budget. It emphasizes free activities, safety, and ethical considerations.

**Important Disclaimer:** Traveling on a 0 THB budget is extremely challenging and requires careful planning, resourcefulness, and a high tolerance for discomfort. This itinerary is designed to be as realistic as possible, but it's essential to be prepared for unexpected situations and prioritize your safety and well-being. Hitchhiking is mentioned as a theoretical option, but it's not generally recommended due to safety concerns.

**Ethical Considerations:**

*   **Respect Local Customs:** Dress modestly when visiting temples (shoulders and knees covered). Be mindful of local traditions and avoid behaviors that might be considered disrespectful.
*   **Avoid Begging:** Do not beg for money or food.
*   **Offer Help:** If someone assists you, offer help in return (e.g., carrying something, cleaning).
*   **Be Grateful:** Express sincere gratitude for any assistance you receive.

**Safety Advice:**

*   **Be Aware of Your Surroundings:** Pay attention to your surroundings at all times, especially at night and in crowded areas.
*   **Avoid Scams:** Be wary of overly friendly strangers offering unsolicited help or deals.
*   **Protect Your Belongings:** Keep your valuables hidden and secure.
*   **Trust Your Instincts:** If a situation feels unsafe, remove yourself immediately.
*   **Emergency Contacts:** Save the numbers for the Tourist Police (1155) and the local emergency services in your phone.
*   **Inform Someone:** Let someone know your itinerary and check in with them regularly.
*   **Learn Basic Thai Phrases:** Knowing a few basic phrases can be helpful in communicating with locals.
*   **Carry a Whistle:** A whistle can be used to attract attention in case of an emergency.
*   **Avoid Walking Alone at Night:** If possible, travel with a companion or stick to well-lit areas.

**Accommodation:**

*   **Temples (Wat):** Contact temples *in advance* to politely inquire about the possibility of sleeping on the temple grounds. Explain your situation and be respectful of their rules. This is not always possible, and it's essential to accept their decision gracefully.
*   **Safe Public Spaces:** If temple accommodation is not available, look for well-lit and populated public spaces, such as parks or train stations. Choose a spot that feels relatively safe and out of the way.
*   **Consider asking locals:** Approach locals and explain your situation and ask if they know of any safe place to sleep.

**Food and Water:**

*   **Pack Food:** The most crucial aspect of a 0 THB trip is to pack enough non-perishable food for the entire duration. Focus on items like dried fruit, nuts, crackers, and energy bars.
*   **Water:** Bring a reusable water bottle and refill it whenever possible. Ask locals if they know of any public water fountains or safe places to refill. Politely ask restaurants or shops if they can spare some water.
*   **Cost-Effective Options (Emergency Only):** If absolutely necessary, look for the cheapest possible food options, such as instant noodles or basic rice dishes from street vendors. *Baan Khao Kaeng Jae Noi* has kept the price of *khao kaeng* (rice served with one side dish) at 10 baht (according to bangkokpost.com), but this information may be outdated.

**Transportation:**

*   **Walking:** Be prepared to walk long distances. Wear comfortable shoes and plan your routes carefully.
*   **Hitchhiking (Not Recommended):** While hitchhiking is technically free, it's generally not recommended due to safety concerns. If you choose to hitchhike, do so with extreme caution and only in areas where it feels relatively safe. Never hitchhike alone, and always trust your instincts.
